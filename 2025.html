    <p>As I sit down to pen my thoughts in writing on the New Year day of 2025, I cannot think of a better idea for an essay besides the number 2025 that is this year.</p>

    <p>I received this as a forward on WhatsApp:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Some interesting mathematical facts of the year, that we are approaching, 2025:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>2025, itself is a square.</li>
        <li>It's a product of two squares, Viz. 9² x 5² = 2025.</li>
        <li>It is the sum of 3-squares, viz. 40²+ 20²+5²= 2025.</li>
        <li>It's the first square after 1936.</li>
        <li>It's the sum of cubes, of all the single digits, from 1 to 9, viz.1³+2³+......9³= 2025.</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <p>These are my thoughts on each of these <q>facts of the year</q>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><blockquote>2025, itself is a square.</blockquote>
        <p>Not only is this true (and interesting), may I remind it is the raison d'être for this essay?  By the way, its square-root is 45.</p>
      </li>

      <li><blockquote>It's a product of two squares, Viz. 9² x 5² = 2025.</blockquote>
        <p>Well, 45 is a composite number i.e., a product of its factors.  Of course, the square of a composite number would be the product of the squares of its factors.  One could have just as well provided an additional example viz., 3² x 15² = 2025.</p>
      </li>

      <li><blockquote>It is the sum of 3-squares, viz. 40²+ 20²+5²= 2025.</blockquote>
        <p>This is interesting, but not because 2025 is a sum of three squares.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre's_three-square_theorem">Legendre's three-square theorem</a> shows that there are infinitely many numbers that can be expressed as the sum of three squares.  For example, 2024 = 8² + 14² + 42² = 10² + 18² + 40².  The reason it is interesting as presented here is the <em>choice</em> of numbers - two of the three squares are 40² and 5².</p>
        <p>We know from elementary school that <code>(a + b)² = (a² + 2ab + b²).</code></p>
        <p>Every two-digit number of the form <code>MN</code> is essentially <code>M0 + N</code> (i.e., <code>M x 10 + N</code>).  For example, <code>37 = 30 + 7</code> and <code>45 = 40 + 5</code>.</p>
        <p>When you expand 37² as (30 + 7)², you get 30² + 2 x 30 x 7 + 7², but the middle term viz., 2 x 30 x 7 is not a perfect square.</p>
        <p>However, when 45², written as (40 + 5)² is expanded to (40² + 2 x 40 x 5 + 5²), it turns out that 2 x 40 x 5 is also a perfect square!</p>
        <p>The other two-digit numbers that can make the same claim as 45 are 15, 51, 54, 59 and 95. In other words, besides 45², only 15², 51², 54², 59² and 95² can be written as the sum of three squares, two of which are from the digits that compose them.  The careful observer would note that the digit that pairs with 5 to make the two-digit number viz., 1, 4, and 9 are the only (non-zero) single-digit squares.</p>
      </li>

      <li><blockquote>It's the first square after 1936.</blockquote>
        <p>This one caught my attention and I took a minute to absorb it.  While it's not a big deal to know that 44² = 1936, it didn't occur to me to see 1936 as a calendar-year.  I am blessed to know a handful of people who have lived to see both these years (we should probably call them <em>The Pythagorean Clique</em> &lt;smiles&gt;).</p>
        <p>Subsequently, I received another WhatsApp forward that highlighted how 1936 and 2025 are the only squares in their respective centuries. I wonder how many of us old enough to read this, are likely to live to see the year 2116?</p>
      </li>

      <li><blockquote>It's the sum of cubes, of all the single digits, from 1 to 9, viz.1³+2³+......9³= 2025.</blockquote>
        <p>Also, the square-root of the year viz., 45 is the sum of all the single-digit numbers i.e., 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45.</p>
        <p>In general, I find it remarkable that the sum of the individual <em>cubes</em> of the first N numbers is the same as the <em>square</em> of the collective sum of the first N numbers i.e.,

        .  There is a just-released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hiNZlIuWE8">beautiful video</a> that provides a geometric explanation for this.  Incidentally, in that video, there are other cool facts about 2025, many of which overlap with this essay.</p>
        <p>To put this is a less math-y way (or in a bombastic management-y way):
        <ul>
          <li>Say you recruit a bunch of rookies.</li>
          <li>You work towards bolstering the strength of each individual - to an extent that each of their strengths is now a <em>cube</em> of what it was (e.g., <code>3 --&gt; 27, 7 --&gt; 343, 11 --&gt; 1331</code>, etc.).</li>
          <li>Only after this, do you put them together to form a team.  Let's call them Team-P.</li>
          <li>Now suppose you find a different set of individuals, but in terms of strengths, each individual here is identical to the corresponding rookie of Team-P at the time of recruitment.  We will call this new team, Team-Q.</li>
          <li>What is different about Team-Q is that we form a team composed of these individuals right at the very beginning.</li>
          <li>Now we work on building the strength of Team-Q - to an extent that their strengths are now just a <em>square</em> of the original team-strength.</li>
          <li>Surprise - Team-P and Team-Q will have equal strength!</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </ol>

    <p>I have a few more of my own observations of 2025 that I would like to share:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>2025 is one of those <A href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=719">somewhat rare numbers</a> that you can write like so: <code>2025 = (20 + 25)²</code>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You can get to 2025 in a scientific calculator without pressing any number in the calculator.  Here is one sequence of steps (I believe it is the one with the fewest steps, but I will be delighted to know if there is a shorter sequence) to get to 2025 without pressing a single number key in your scientific calculator:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Press the <code>n!</code> (factorial) button.  Since you start with <code>0</code> and <code>0! = 1</code>, you will now have <code>1</code>.</li>
          <li>Do a <code>Tan<sup>-1</sup></code>.  If you are in "DEG" (degrees) mode, you will have <code>45</code>.</li>
          <li>Square the number.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
